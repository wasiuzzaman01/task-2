        Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. The goal is to enable machines to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve problems by analyzing and learning from past experiences (data).<br>
<pre style="font-size: medium;">
 There are three main types of machine learning:

 1.Supervised Learning: In this type, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the data includes both input features and the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

 Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.

 2.Unsupervised Learning: Here, the model is trained on data that does not include labeled outputs. The goal is to   find patterns, structures, or relationships in the data.

 Example: Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior using clustering algorithms.

 3.Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning involves training a model to make a sequence of decisions by  rewarding or punishing it based on the actions it takes. The model learns to maximize cumulative reward over time.
